1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[silence]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey Hannah, this is Frederik. Can you hear me?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, I can hear you. Okay, great. I can hear you too. So I just

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
started the recording in Zoom, so you can just confirm that, then it's

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
out of the way. And with that said,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
just wait until you hear the first message and then

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
start with the task. And

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm out now, but I'm following along.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, I am a voice agent here to support you

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
during the design task. I can hear what you are saying, and I can see your screen

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and follow along with you while you work on the task. Occasionally,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will ask you questions that are supposed to help you think through the design task.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
[silence]

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah.

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:44,840
So the goal is to create the bracket within the defined space.

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm thinking about where to start. I'm thinking if we don't want anything generated outside the box, I should maybe make

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:12,840
an object outside of the box to limit it so that it doesn't design here.

19
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,840
So I'll just make it, I'll just extrude on each frame.

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:39,840
That's not how you do that.

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
And I'll just do that with all of them.

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I don't know if I can do it all at the same time.

23
00:02:47,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Okay.

24
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:26,840
So then I'll just mark those as obstacles for the study.

25
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Okay.

26
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:48,840
So if it has to carry this much weight, then I should add a load.

27
00:05:48,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Okay.

28
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I need to consider 1250 kilograms of engine weight, and that will be distributed among these three bolts.

29
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Which I could probably assume is distributed evenly in the Y direction.

30
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:23,840
If that assumes that no force is applied at this point, at the damper connection, because I'm not really sure how that fastens.

31
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Okay.

32
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:58,840
So downward force in the Y direction at the bolts, which will also kind of be a moment at.

33
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Okay.

34
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:41,840
So the bolts are connected to the engine, but they're supposed to carry the engine weight.

35
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:52,840
But the damper, assuming it's significantly lighter than the engine, is not carried by the bolts.

36
00:08:52,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I'm not quite sure how the bolts carry the weight of the engine, considering.

37
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:28,840
It would seem like this bottom plate would carry more of the weight.

38
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm not really sure where the weight is being applied.

39
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:58,840
If the load is being applied at these three bolts. I'm not really sure how.

40
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:22,840
I want it to be.

41
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:40,840
So the engine weight is being applied on the bracket.

42
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Like on top of this metal piece here that isn't touching anything. I'm not really sure how that happens.

43
00:10:46,840 --> 00:11:09,840
But if that were the case, then that applied weight would cause a moment in the bolts.

44
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Okay.

45
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:48,840
So the force is being applied from the damper. I see, I see.

46
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:56,840
So it's actually an upward Y force being applied by the damper.

47
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:15,840
So the force would be coming from here, which means that the bolts are providing a reaction force in the negative Y direction.

48
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Which means it's a moment that way.

49
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:38,840
So we want the bracket to be strong in that direction.

50
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Sure.

51
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,840
If I were to draw a free body diagram, I would say the applied force is that way in the positive Y.

52
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Right. So why? Sure. Oh, that's the axis. Okay.

53
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:15,840
So in the positive Z. Which means the reaction forces are in the negative Y direction over here.

54
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:28,840
And this applies a moment in the.

55
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:36,840
If that's the X axis, then the applied force is providing a negative moment around the X axis.

56
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,840
So we want the part to provide a positive X moment.

57
00:13:44,840 --> 00:14:13,840
So I'll just add in the applied force, which I think is in the generative section.

58
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Okay.

59
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Okay, I should probably fix these existing parts.

60
00:14:48,840 --> 00:15:13,840
No obstacles. Oh, wait. I already did obstacles.

61
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:26,840
This part isn't.

62
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Right now it's kind of levitating, but the bolts are fixed.

63
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:21,840
So I'll add the load here.

64
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:43,840
So I'm just finding this in Newton's.

65
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Okay. So that's the applied force of the damper.

66
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Not sure how to distribute that. It kind of looks like a point force. But maybe that's fine.

67
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm assuming that Fusion knows that will apply a moment over there.

68
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:44,840
So I'll move on.

69
00:17:44,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I'll add the materials.

70
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Doesn't specify a factor of safety, so I'll say two.

71
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Okay.

72
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Not very much. I understand three axis milling, but I'm not sure about five axis milling and die casting.

73
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Yeah, I also don't know what that is.

74
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,840
But I'll just add them all, since we have the option to do all of them.

75
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Not sure how to add die cast.

76
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm assuming die casting is more advanced than three axis milling.

77
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
So.

78
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Wait, I forgot the question.

79
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Oh.

80
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
I'm not sure.

81
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:59,840
I mean, three axis is fewer axes than five, so it would probably be less advanced or precise.

82
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:11,840
I'm not sure about die casting.

83
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Casting.

84
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Ejection direction.

85
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:54,840
How might the die casting settings impact the generated shapes?

86
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:14,840
How die casting works, but I'm assuming if I select it as an option, it will create some models that are only doable via die casting, which I think is feasible, given the specifications.

87
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm just going to go with the pre selected option.

88
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:36,840
And put in the options for materials which are stainless steel, cast iron, and one more.

89
00:21:36,840 --> 00:22:03,840
So.

90
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Cast iron.

91
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,840
And if I had to pick one more.

92
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Something light but strong.

93
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:38,840
I'm not really sure.

94
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I know you can mill with aluminum.

95
00:22:48,840 --> 00:23:17,840
She just Google.

96
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Okay.

97
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Okay.

98
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm going to pick aluminum.

99
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I could also compare their yield strengths.

100
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm going to pick aluminum.

101
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,840
Hey, does the brackets and engines environment impact the material choice in any way?

102
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Yes.

103
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,840
It can't melt at high temperatures, it has to be.

104
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Pretty heat resistant.

105
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:43,840
I forget the metric for that.

106
00:25:43,840 --> 00:26:12,840
It could also be a good option, except I think that's really heavy.

107
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Also not sure if you can mill it.

108
00:26:37,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Okay.

109
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,840
So for weight purposes, I would choose aluminum, but.

110
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm not sure about the heat constraints of the engine.

111
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:57,840
I think I'll stick with aluminum.

112
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Definitely cheaper.

113
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Okay.

114
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,840
I have to make sure that the materials can be manufactured in one of these three ways.

115
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
And that it's serviceable.

116
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Meaning, it could be removed and altered if needed.

117
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Which I think all of these materials are able to be modified.

118
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,840
And.

119
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Yeah.

120
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Other than that.

121
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Okay.

122
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Three connection points. Minimize weight, maximize strength.

123
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,840
And I fixed those three points, so that's good. Machine ability.

124
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:35,840
All those types can be machined using a mill.

125
00:30:35,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I'm assuming for generative design. Wow.

126
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Machine ability, cost.

127
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,840
All three are pretty common.

128
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Assembly operations.

129
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,840
All three can be bolted just fine.

130
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Serviceability.

131
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Because that depends more on.

132
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:40,840
How you bolt it, so it can't be permanent but as long as you can take the bolts in and out, that should be fine.

133
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Maintenance, same thing if you can take the bolts out.

134
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
So it just can't block.

135
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
The damper.

136
00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Which I think this constraint is good enough for that.

137
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,840
There's also going to be something going through the middle so it can't block that so I should make.

138
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:18,840
This top part of the damper so that it doesn't build anything there.

139
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:34,840
That would be designed.

140
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Where's that part of the bracket?

141
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Hey, what are you trying to do?

142
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:20,840
I'm just trying to make the obstacle so that it doesn't build the bracket where this black thing is. So that the damper can go through the hole unobstructed by the bracket.

143
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,840
What's your strategy for that?

144
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:36,840
I'm just trying to extrude this rig, but I might just draw a new sketch and extrude that instead.

145
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Hey Hannah, it's Frederick. Can you hear me?

146
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Yes, I can.

147
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Okay, great.

148
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I'm just stepping in quickly here because also of the time.

149
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:57,840
It looks like you're about to model something that you would use as obstacle geometry in that dampener connection, correct?

150
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Yes.

151
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Okay, just as a shortcut because that saves a lot of modeling, fiddling around.

152
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:17,840
If you go back to the generative design mode, right, and then you go to edit model, which is in the upper ribbon menu.

153
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Yep, exactly.

154
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,840
So this is like a mode where you can model additional obstacle geometry.

155
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:35,840
And if you go to model components and the viewer, and then bodies and you hide all the surrounding, right, otherwise it's hard to see.

156
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:47,840
And if you now go to the upper ribbon again, and I think the fourth icon, this one, obstacle connection or connector obstacle tool.

157
00:34:47,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Sorry, that's exactly what that does. It helps you to build like these pin like obstacles, which are basically mimicking bolts.

158
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,840
So if you select that, there's like an interactive dialogue which pops up on the right.

159
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,840
And then, for example, for the, you select the inner ring.

160
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Yep. And then you have different settings you can say also. Yeah, right.

161
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:26,840
And you could also theoretically add a bolt head with that option if you want, but that should help you to be quicker.

162
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Okay, thank you.

163
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Yeah, you're welcome. I'm out.

164
00:35:47,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll also do that for these bolts as well.

165
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Yeah.

166
00:36:45,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Okay, so now when it constructs.

167
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,840
The.

168
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Now reconstructs the bracket it won't put anything in those bolts that will be there.

169
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,840
And it will just go in between, and there's room for the damper, the top of the damper here.

170
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,840
And also will go outside of the space constraints.

171
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,840
So that should be all good.

172
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Hey, would running a preview simulation help.

173
00:37:46,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I'll do the pre check again.

174
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, because it's fixed.

175
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I'll fix that.

176
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Hey Hannah it's Frederick again, sorry.

177
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:27,840
I think the way the obstacle connector tool works with a bolt head I think if I saw it correctly.

178
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,840
It might interfere with the preserve geometry now.

179
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Yeah.

180
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:48,840
I think you would need to select the other ring, like from the other side so that the bolt head basically.

181
00:38:48,840 --> 00:39:01,840
I think you would always select the lowest kind of like circle or ring to define the obstacle bolt.

182
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,840
So I'm not sure if you can say edit now if you would need to, to build it again.

183
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Okay, so like, just like it from this side, you're saying. Yeah, exactly. That's what I meant correctly.

184
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,840
So maybe select the entire body on the, on the left and the viewer.

185
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Yep. Okay, I guess that's better. Otherwise it only wants to select the face.

186
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,840
And I think if you now, right, if you select it from this side.

187
00:39:49,840 --> 00:40:02,840
And say old hat, or what does it know it looks still the same. And if you drag it to the other side.

188
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Not sure if that did anything.

189
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,840
It's strange. Why does it?

190
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,840
That look look better I think if you drag it out to the other side.

191
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Yeah, but no.

192
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Yeah, because if it can't stick out from that side.

193
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Then maybe it's just the bolt head that's causing the problem.

194
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,840
If I do it like that, that should have a similar effect. Okay, and if you now select bolt head.

195
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,840
What is it doing? No, it's strange.

196
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Head length. Oh, maybe because head length is zero.

197
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Oh, no, no, but it's okay then go back and just select the other side. Sorry about that.

198
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,840
So if you undo this, or just say cancel.

199
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,840
And select the ring you selected previously.

200
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Maybe I was wrong. Yes, select the other like the one you select before. Maybe that wasn't a problem.

201
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Maybe you did that correctly.

202
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,840
And okay, if you move it out now.

203
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,840
That looks better. Yeah, I think that because head length was zero. I think that was the main problem.

204
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Okay. Okay, I think that should be better. Yeah, sorry about that.

205
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,840
But I think that that looks correct. Yeah. Okay, I'm out.

206
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,840
[silence]

207
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,840
[silence]

208
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,840
If we want accessibility to the bolts, there should probably also be space in front of that.

209
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,840
[silence]

210
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,840
[silence]

211
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,840
[silence]

212
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:58,840
I learned that I should probably add obstacles in front of the bolts for accessibility and ease of maintenance.

213
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:04,840
[silence]

214
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,840
[silence]

215
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,840
[silence]

216
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,840
[silence]

217
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,840
So that would be in design.

218
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,840
[silence]

219
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,840
And I could extrude as a separate body.

220
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Yeah, new body.

221
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Just by maybe

222
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,840
two centimeters.

223
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,840
[silence]

224
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
So I'm just adding those as obstacles.

225
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,840
[silence]

226
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Assuming that's what it's doing in there.

227
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,840
[silence]

228
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,840
Hey Hannah, it's Frederick. Sorry to step in.

229
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:10,840
It's always a bit finicky. So maybe you could go to model components in the browser on the left.

230
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Right, and then manually hide the bodies that you use as a shell.

231
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,840
Hide those there.

232
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,840
And then when you show the obstacle geometry down there in the study, right.

233
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:36,040
Right then you it's yeah otherwise with a shell that's always blocking the view

234
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:44,040
but that looks looks good I'm out.

235
00:46:44,040 --> 00:47:05,960
Okay so now I yeah I've added those as obstacles and so

236
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,200
I'll preview again.

237
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:34,040
So now it allows some space to have access to the bolts.

238
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:41,880
Hey what did you learn from evaluating the preview? Is there anything you would like to change?

239
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:51,720
Other than this no I think everything else looks okay.

240
00:47:51,720 --> 00:48:08,360
So I'll select oh wait no that's later so I'll

241
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:16,120
so I think it looks good.

242
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:27,960
Hey Hannah it's Frederick. Okay when you think it's ready to send to the solver you can send it off.

243
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,520
Okay.

244
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:43,880
I mean just yeah mentioned that there are some bodies hidden.

245
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:55,720
And you can yep press the generate study. Awesome yay okay.

246
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:03,960
All right and now it takes like as I said like 30 around 30 to 40 minutes until it's solved but

247
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:11,800
also it's four minutes past three. I'm sorry that it took four minutes longer but awesome generally

248
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:22,120
wonderful. Also you stayed more or less in time so let me kind of like stop the recording and then I'll.

249
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Hey I am a voice agent here to support you during the design task. I can hear what you are saying

250
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,440
and I can see your screen and follow along with you while you work on the task.

251
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:48,600
Occasionally I will ask you questions that are supposed to help you think through the design task.

252
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:59,800
So

253
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:07,000
you

254
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:28,360
okay. Hey here is a question for you. What do you think about the generated design?

255
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,680
Is there anything you would like to change?

256
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,320
I think the generated design

257
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:43,720
is good. It definitely would fit in the allotted space. There's plenty of space in front of each

258
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:54,200
of the bolt areas to go back and perform maintenance. This one in the back might be

259
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:07,880
a little tight. Yeah I mean the way it looks with all these like lumps along the edge would

260
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,480
be hard to specifically manufacture but that might just be this design.

261
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:19,320
Great can you explain what is your goal when comparing the different designs?

262
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:33,000
When comparing them I would say to find you know the one that looks like it would be

263
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,560
simplest to manufacture that you could produce multiple in a short amount of time

264
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:48,440
and of course meets all the requirements. It's strong hopefully not too heavy.

265
00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah it can carry the proper weight but also be yeah lightweight like it says.

266
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:17,720
So I want to compare yeah these aspects to pick the best outcomes.

267
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:28,360
Great can you explain how you think the designs differ regarding aspects of manufacturing and

268
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:37,400
assembly? Yeah so I'm not super familiar with all of these manufacturing methods

269
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,480
but like I was saying about this first one I was looking at how it's kind of

270
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,360
lumpy and there aren't really like smooth lines and edges.

271
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:55,080
That's something you have to make probably a specific mold for

272
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:06,600
or you know something like this you wouldn't mill but the general shape you know without those very

273
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:15,960
specific kind of textures something more like this how it's smooth edges flat sides

274
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:29,400
that would be easier to manufacture.

275
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:49,000
So yeah with this one it seems like it kind of even though technically there's space in

276
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,520
front of that area you wouldn't be able to access that if it were on the damper.

277
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,360
You could only access it from the bottom which I believe is not possible

278
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,440
or maybe technically that could be possible but it's not the easiest way to access

279
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,080
that back bolt back here.

280
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:18,040
And also this one has a lot of material so I assume it would be heavy.

281
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:23,160
Okay and how much do you trust the generated designs?

282
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,520
How much do I trust the generated designs?

283
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:40,680
I think that would depend on you know their qualities listed over here factor safety

284
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,920
maximum stress.

285
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,480
Um I likely wouldn't just like send something like this off to be immediately manufactured

286
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,880
I would kind of maybe make some edits or make my own model.

287
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:12,040
Um like I said with you know none of these like kind of curvy chunky areas.

288
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:24,760
But I would say this one I would be fairly confident in it has access from that side back here.

289
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:31,640
Um factor safety two.

290
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:38,920
Raise less than a kilogram.

291
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:51,800
Okay.

292
00:55:51,800 --> 00:56:02,680
So

293
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:13,560
so

294
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:29,800
so I'm just kind of going through and comparing all of these metrics over here.

295
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,080
I can see that this one is pretty similar to the one that was recommended.

296
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,800
I'll come forward.

297
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,560
Hey Hannah it's Frederick.

298
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,400
Hi.

299
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,040
Can you hear me?

300
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,320
Yes.

301
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,800
Great.

302
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:57,240
Just as a reminder you can also um at the top left of that view you can change the display.

303
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:05,160
So there you have like a card sort of like display when you click on it and you see what I mean and

304
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:12,280
it can be easier sometimes to compare or even the scatter plot on the one further right where it

305
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,000
plays out like more like from a stats perspective like minimum factor of safety and mass.

306
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,200
And then I think also you can if you go back to the to the gallery view right you can

307
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,760
I think when you hover over one of the designs yeah you can select it and I think

308
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,240
by that select an outcome or can you star it um I think you can then

309
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,920
compare even multiple ones together.

310
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:53,480
All right click and and star it I think how did that work uh no there is some some way maybe if

311
00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:00,360
you I think if you have multiple ones but there's the idea that I think if you select multiple ones

312
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,400
you can compare them even maybe on the bottom it says multiple selection I'm sorry I'm not I'm not

313
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:14,440
entirely sure how it works yeah click that one okay oh yeah right so that might be might be

314
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,080
useful okay I'm out just a couple of hints thank you.

315
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:30,680
Thank you.

316
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,280
Thank you.

317
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:49,080
Thank you.

318
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,680
Thank you.

319
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:27,000
So it seems like from comparing these that a displacement of under a millimeter is pretty good

320
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,120
and a mass of under a kilogram is pretty good.

321
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,440
When comparing all of these that seems like the general range

322
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,360
like something like this seems like too much of a displacement

323
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:50,920
compared to how the majority of these are under a millimeter. I'm saying with

324
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,040
the mass a lot of these ones down here are over a kilogram but then these ones

325
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:02,120
are closer to that one kilogram range.

326
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Thank you.

327
01:01:52,440 --> 01:02:00,360
This one is super lightweight and has a comparable max stress to all of these other

328
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,120
heavier models so I would say that is one I would keep.

329
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:12,440
Up here.

330
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:22,440
Hey, what impact and difference does the manufacturing method have on the generated geometry?

331
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:33,880
Well this says additive manufacturing which means that you're more able to do

332
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,680
different kinds of shapes. There are fewer limitations

333
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,640
on what kind of lines and shapes you can do as far as I know.

334
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,680
So that should be fine.

335
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,120
Hannah it's Frederick again. I just saw like there's like a star

336
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:04,840
in that view when you go to the top menu bar and then to the left you see like a tagging you can

337
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,000
add it to favorites. I think that's how it works so if you want to kind of like say okay that's

338
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,480
one of the designs I want to keep you can say star and then if you go back I think it keeps it.

339
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:21,560
Yeah right and the top right in the gallery you see there's a star

340
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,360
so that's also how you can keep track which ones you.

341
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:36,440
Okay, if you give favor. Sorry, so now okay wait one second you see it now here.

342
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:44,280
Okay so and the thumbs up are the ones Fusion suggests which also the ones up here.

343
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:53,960
Okay and I'll pick three or four for the three. Okay right unless you want to make

344
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,880
changes but you can also just select three. Okay all right I'm out.

345
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:11,160
So

346
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:22,440
so

347
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:36,440
I think I'll also select this one because

348
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,400
of its pretty comparable statistics. The displacement is less than a millimeter and

349
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:51,000
it's fairly light considering how much material there is with a strength you know comparable to

350
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:05,000
the rest of them and though it says the method is casting it seems like it could be done with

351
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,080
other methods but I'm no manufacturing expert.

352
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:21,160
So

353
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:31,240
so

354
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:52,520
hey how important is the mass to strength ratio of the pieces in your evaluation?

355
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,240
We would want

356
01:05:53,240 --> 01:06:04,920
low mass to high strength. I would say that's pretty important considering that our goals are

357
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:14,840
to minimize the weight and maximize the strength. So I think from this one

358
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:25,720
yeah so this other one has a much better mass to strength ratio

359
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:32,600
so maybe I should rethink that.

360
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:53,400
Oh this one is even lighter than that first one that I picked 0.536 kilograms.

361
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:07,400
This one has a really high factor of safety.

362
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:17,640
But it seems like mass to strength is more important.

363
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:24,600
So inevitably we'll have to sacrifice.

364
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:44,200
I'm not sure but it seems that aluminum provides the most lightweight solution

365
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:53,320
because all of these recommended outcomes are aluminum because they have that mass

366
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,280
to strength ratio that minimizes mass and maximizes strength whereas

367
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,480
yeah like stainless steel they're all pretty high in the mass category

368
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:18,360
and same with iron which it gives them a higher factor of safety but or not necessarily for

369
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:25,400
stainless steel but aluminum seems to really maximize how lightweight it can be while still

370
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:38,200
being strong. So I think I'll also start this.

371
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:48,840
So that should be three.

372
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:55,560
