00:01:32,Hey!..... What are you trying to do?
00:06:04,Hey!..... One question... What are the loads you need to consider?
00:07:24,Hey.... One more question...What other forces and moments could be relevant for the bracket?
00:08:24,How will the bracket be connected to other parts and will these move in any way?
00:09:36,One other question... What are the structural constraints of your load cases?
00:12:40,Hey... One consideration... Would drawing a free-body diagram help?
00:18:40,Hey... One question... How familiar are you with these manufacturing processes?
00:19:11,Hey... Can you explain what you think how these manufacturing settings will impact the generated designs?
00:19:37,Hey... Can you explain what you think how these manufacturing settings will impact the generated designs?
00:20:45,Hey... How might the die casting settings impact the generated shapes?
00:22:27,Here's a question about the materials... What are suitable materials for the manufacturing processes?
00:24:47,Hey... does the bracket's and engine's environment impact the material choice in any way?
00:28:19,Hey... What are your considerations regarding manufacturing when selecting materials?
00:32:50,Hey... what are you trying to do?
00:33:21,What's your strategy for that?
00:37:33,Hey... would running a preview simulation help?
00:43:43,Hey... What did you learn from evaluating the preview? Is there anything you would like to change?
00:47:37,Hey... What did you learn from evaluating the preview? Is there anything you would like to change?

00:50:26,"Hey… Here is a question for you… What do you think about the generated design?
Is there anything you would like to change?"
00:51:17,Great... Can you explain…What is your goal when comparing the different designs?
00:52:25,Great.... Can you explain how you think the designs differ regarding aspects of manufacturing and assembly? 
00:54:22,Ok... And How much do you trust the generated designs?
01:02:20,Hey... what impact and difference does the manufacturing method have on the generated geometry?
01:05:47,Hey... how important is the mass-to-strength ratio of the pieces in your evaluation?
01:07:26,Hey..  Which material and manufacturing method combination do you think works best for this task?
