00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
[silence]

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey Hannah, this is Frederik. Can you hear me?

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, I can hear you. Okay, great. I can hear you too. So I just

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
started the recording in Zoom, so you can just confirm that, then it's

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
out of the way. And with that said,

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
just wait until you hear the first message and then

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
start with the task. And

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm out now, but I'm following along.

00:00:37 --> 00:00:52,000
Hey!..... I am a voice agent here to support you during the design task.....I can hear what you are saying, and I can see your screen and follow along with you while you work on the task. Occasionally, I will ask you questions that are supposed to help you think through the design task.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay.

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
[silence]

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:21,840
Yeah.

00:01:32 --> 00:01:44,840
Hey!..... What are you trying to do?

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:44,840
So the goal is to create the bracket within the defined space.

00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:55,840
I'm thinking about where to start. I'm thinking if we don't want anything generated outside the box, I should maybe make

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:12,840
an object outside of the box to limit it so that it doesn't design here.

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,840
So I'll just make it, I'll just extrude on each frame.

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:39,840
That's not how you do that.

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
And I'll just do that with all of them.

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,840
I don't know if I can do it all at the same time.

00:02:47,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Okay.

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:26,840
So then I'll just mark those as obstacles for the study.

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Okay.

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:48,840
So if it has to carry this much weight, then I should add a load.

00:06:04 --> 00:06:09,840
Hey!..... One question... What are the loads you need to consider?

00:05:48,840 --> 00:06:09,840
Okay.

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:27,840
I need to consider 1250 kilograms of engine weight, and that will be distributed among these three bolts.

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:56,840
Which I could probably assume is distributed evenly in the Y direction.

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:23,840
If that assumes that no force is applied at this point, at the damper connection, because I'm not really sure how that fastens.

00:07:24 --> 00:07:33,840
Hey.... One more question...What other forces and moments could be relevant for the bracket?

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,840
Okay.

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:58,840
So downward force in the Y direction at the bolts, which will also kind of be a moment at.

00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:23,840
Okay.

00:08:24 --> 00:08:41,840
How will the bracket be connected to other parts and will these move in any way?

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:41,840
So the bolts are connected to the engine, but they're supposed to carry the engine weight.

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:52,840
But the damper, assuming it's significantly lighter than the engine, is not carried by the bolts.

00:08:52,840 --> 00:09:01,840
I'm not quite sure how the bolts carry the weight of the engine, considering.

00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:28,840
It would seem like this bottom plate would carry more of the weight.

00:09:36 --> 00:09:48,840
One other question... What are the structural constraints of your load cases?

00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm not really sure where the weight is being applied.

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:58,840
If the load is being applied at these three bolts. I'm not really sure how.

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:22,840
I want it to be.

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:40,840
So the engine weight is being applied on the bracket.

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Like on top of this metal piece here that isn't touching anything. I'm not really sure how that happens.

00:10:46,840 --> 00:11:09,840
But if that were the case, then that applied weight would cause a moment in the bolts.

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Okay.

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:48,840
So the force is being applied from the damper. I see, I see.

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:56,840
So it's actually an upward Y force being applied by the damper.

00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:15,840
So the force would be coming from here, which means that the bolts are providing a reaction force in the negative Y direction.

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Which means it's a moment that way.

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:38,840
So we want the bracket to be strong in that direction.

00:12:40 --> 00:12:54,840
Hey... One consideration... Would drawing a free-body diagram help?

00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Sure.

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,840
If I were to draw a free body diagram, I would say the applied force is that way in the positive Y.

00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Right. So why? Sure. Oh, that's the axis. Okay.

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:15,840
So in the positive Z. Which means the reaction forces are in the negative Y direction over here.

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:28,840
And this applies a moment in the.

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:36,840
If that's the X axis, then the applied force is providing a negative moment around the X axis.

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,840
So we want the part to provide a positive X moment.

00:13:44,840 --> 00:14:13,840
So I'll just add in the applied force, which I think is in the generative section.

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Okay.

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Okay, I should probably fix these existing parts.

00:14:48,840 --> 00:15:13,840
No obstacles. Oh, wait. I already did obstacles.

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:26,840
This part isn't.

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:55,840
Right now it's kind of levitating, but the bolts are fixed.

00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:21,840
So I'll add the load here.

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:43,840
So I'm just finding this in Newton's.

00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Okay. So that's the applied force of the damper.

00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Not sure how to distribute that. It kind of looks like a point force. But maybe that's fine.

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm assuming that Fusion knows that will apply a moment over there.

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:44,840
So I'll move on.

00:17:44,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I'll add the materials.

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Doesn't specify a factor of safety, so I'll say two.

00:18:40 --> 00:18:46,840
Hey... One question... How familiar are you with these manufacturing processes?

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Okay.

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Not very much. I understand three axis milling, but I'm not sure about five axis milling and die casting.

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Yeah, I also don't know what that is.

00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,840
But I'll just add them all, since we have the option to do all of them.

00:19:11 --> 00:19:20,840
Hey... Can you explain what you think how these manufacturing settings will impact the generated designs?

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Not sure how to add die cast.

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:29,840
I'm assuming die casting is more advanced than three axis milling.

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,840
So.

00:19:37 --> 00:19:42,840
Hey... Can you explain what you think how these manufacturing settings will impact the generated designs?

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Wait, I forgot the question.

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Oh.

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,840
I'm not sure.

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:59,840
I mean, three axis is fewer axes than five, so it would probably be less advanced or precise.

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:11,840
I'm not sure about die casting.

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Casting.

00:20:45 --> 00:20:54,840
Hey... How might the die casting settings impact the generated shapes?

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Ejection direction.

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:14,840
How die casting works, but I'm assuming if I select it as an option, it will create some models that are only doable via die casting, which I think is feasible, given the specifications.

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm just going to go with the pre selected option.

00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:36,840
And put in the options for materials which are stainless steel, cast iron, and one more.

00:21:36,840 --> 00:22:03,840
So.

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Cast iron.

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,840
And if I had to pick one more.

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Something light but strong.

00:22:27 --> 00:22:38,840
Here's a question about the materials... What are suitable materials for the manufacturing processes?

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:38,840
I'm not really sure.

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:48,840
I know you can mill with aluminum.

00:22:48,840 --> 00:23:17,840
She just Google.

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Okay.

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Okay.

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm going to pick aluminum.

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I could also compare their yield strengths.

00:24:47 --> 00:24:52,840
Hey... does the bracket's and engine's environment impact the material choice in any way?

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:45,840
I'm going to pick aluminum.

00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Yes.

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,840
It can't melt at high temperatures, it has to be.

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Pretty heat resistant.

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:43,840
I forget the metric for that.

00:25:43,840 --> 00:26:12,840
It could also be a good option, except I think that's really heavy.

00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Also not sure if you can mill it.

00:26:37,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Okay.

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,840
So for weight purposes, I would choose aluminum, but.

00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm not sure about the heat constraints of the engine.

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:57,840
I think I'll stick with aluminum.

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:18,840
Definitely cheaper.

00:28:19 --> 00:28:28,840
Hey... What are your considerations regarding manufacturing when selecting materials?

00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:28,840
Okay.

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,840
I have to make sure that the materials can be manufactured in one of these three ways.

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,840
And that it's serviceable.

00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Meaning, it could be removed and altered if needed.

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Which I think all of these materials are able to be modified.

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,840
And.

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Yeah.

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:32,840
Other than that.

00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:55,840
Okay.

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Three connection points. Minimize weight, maximize strength.

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,840
And I fixed those three points, so that's good. Machine ability.

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:35,840
All those types can be machined using a mill.

00:30:35,840 --> 00:31:04,840
I'm assuming for generative design. Wow.

00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,840
Machine ability, cost.

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,840
All three are pretty common.

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Assembly operations.

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,840
All three can be bolted just fine.

00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,840
Serviceability.

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
Because that depends more on.

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:40,840
How you bolt it, so it can't be permanent but as long as you can take the bolts in and out, that should be fine.

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Maintenance, same thing if you can take the bolts out.

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
So it just can't block.

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
The damper.

00:31:50,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Which I think this constraint is good enough for that.

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,840
There's also going to be something going through the middle so it can't block that so I should make.

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:18,840
This top part of the damper so that it doesn't build anything there.

00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:34,840
That would be designed.

00:32:50 --> 00:32:53,840
Hey... what are you trying to do?

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:49,840
Where's that part of the bracket?

00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:20,840
I'm just trying to make the obstacle so that it doesn't build the bracket where this black thing is. So that the damper can go through the hole unobstructed by the bracket.

00:33:21 --> 00:33:24,840
What's your strategy for that?

00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,840
What's your strategy for that?

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:36,840
I'm just trying to extrude this rig, but I might just draw a new sketch and extrude that instead.

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
Hey Hannah, it's Frederick. Can you hear me?

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Yes, I can.

00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
Okay, great.

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,840
I'm just stepping in quickly here because also of the time.

00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:57,840
It looks like you're about to model something that you would use as obstacle geometry in that dampener connection, correct?

00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Yes.

00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Okay, just as a shortcut because that saves a lot of modeling, fiddling around.

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:17,840
If you go back to the generative design mode, right, and then you go to edit model, which is in the upper ribbon menu.

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Yep, exactly.

00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,840
So this is like a mode where you can model additional obstacle geometry.

00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:35,840
And if you go to model components and the viewer, and then bodies and you hide all the surrounding, right, otherwise it's hard to see.

00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:47,840
And if you now go to the upper ribbon again, and I think the fourth icon, this one, obstacle connection or connector obstacle tool.

00:34:47,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Sorry, that's exactly what that does. It helps you to build like these pin like obstacles, which are basically mimicking bolts.

00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,840
So if you select that, there's like an interactive dialogue which pops up on the right.

00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,840
And then, for example, for the, you select the inner ring.

00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Yep. And then you have different settings you can say also. Yeah, right.

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:26,840
And you could also theoretically add a bolt head with that option if you want, but that should help you to be quicker.

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Okay, thank you.

00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Yeah, you're welcome. I'm out.

00:35:47,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I'll also do that for these bolts as well.

00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Yeah.

00:36:45,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Okay, so now when it constructs.

00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,840
The.

00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Now reconstructs the bracket it won't put anything in those bolts that will be there.

00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,840
And it will just go in between, and there's room for the damper, the top of the damper here.

00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,840
And also will go outside of the space constraints.

00:37:33 --> 00:37:46,840
Hey... would running a preview simulation help?

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,840
So that should be all good.

00:37:46,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I'll do the pre check again.

00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Oh, because it's fixed.

00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I'll fix that.

00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,840
Hey Hannah it's Frederick again, sorry.

00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:27,840
I think the way the obstacle connector tool works with a bolt head I think if I saw it correctly.

00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,840
It might interfere with the preserve geometry now.

00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,840
Yeah.

00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:48,840
I think you would need to select the other ring, like from the other side so that the bolt head basically.

00:38:48,840 --> 00:39:01,840
I think you would always select the lowest kind of like circle or ring to define the obstacle bolt.

00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,840
So I'm not sure if you can say edit now if you would need to, to build it again.

00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Okay, so like, just like it from this side, you're saying. Yeah, exactly. That's what I meant correctly.

00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,840
So maybe select the entire body on the, on the left and the viewer.

00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:43,840
Yep. Okay, I guess that's better. Otherwise it only wants to select the face.

00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,840
And I think if you now, right, if you select it from this side.

00:39:49,840 --> 00:40:02,840
And say old hat, or what does it know it looks still the same. And if you drag it to the other side.

00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Not sure if that did anything.

00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,840
It's strange. Why does it?

00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,840
That look look better I think if you drag it out to the other side.

00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Yeah, but no.

00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Yeah, because if it can't stick out from that side.

00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Then maybe it's just the bolt head that's causing the problem.

00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,840
If I do it like that, that should have a similar effect. Okay, and if you now select bolt head.

00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,840
What is it doing? No, it's strange.

00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,840
Head length. Oh, maybe because head length is zero.

00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Oh, no, no, but it's okay then go back and just select the other side. Sorry about that.

00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,840
So if you undo this, or just say cancel.

00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,840
And select the ring you selected previously.

00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Maybe I was wrong. Yes, select the other like the one you select before. Maybe that wasn't a problem.

00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Maybe you did that correctly.

00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,840
And okay, if you move it out now.

00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,840
That looks better. Yeah, I think that because head length was zero. I think that was the main problem.

00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Okay. Okay, I think that should be better. Yeah, sorry about that.

00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,840
But I think that that looks correct. Yeah. Okay, I'm out.

00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:54,840
[silence]

00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,840
[silence]

00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:28,840
If we want accessibility to the bolts, there should probably also be space in front of that.

00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,840
[silence]

00:43:43 --> 00:43:44,840
Hey... What did you learn from evaluating the preview? Is there anything you would like to change?

00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,840
[silence]

00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,840
[silence]

00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:58,840
I learned that I should probably add obstacles in front of the bolts for accessibility and ease of maintenance.

00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:04,840
[silence]

00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,840
[silence]

00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,840
[silence]

00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,840
[silence]

00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,840
So that would be in design.

00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,840
[silence]

00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,840
And I could extrude as a separate body.

00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Yeah, new body.

00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Just by maybe

00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,840
two centimeters.

00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:54,840
[silence]

00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
So I'm just adding those as obstacles.

00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,840
[silence]

00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,840
Assuming that's what it's doing in there.

00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,840
[silence]

00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,840
Hey Hannah, it's Frederick. Sorry to step in.

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:10,840
It's always a bit finicky. So maybe you could go to model components in the browser on the left.

00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Right, and then manually hide the bodies that you use as a shell.

00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,840
Hide those there.

00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:30,840
And then when you show the obstacle geometry down there in the study, right.

00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:36,040
Right then you it's yeah otherwise with a shell that's always blocking the view

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:44,040
but that looks looks good I'm out.

00:46:44,040 --> 00:47:05,960
Okay so now I yeah I've added those as obstacles and so

00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,200
I'll preview again.

00:47:37 --> 00:47:42,760
Hey... What did you learn from evaluating the preview? Is there anything you would like to change?

00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:34,040
So now it allows some space to have access to the bolts.

00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:51,720
Other than this no I think everything else looks okay.

00:47:51,720 --> 00:48:08,360
So I'll select oh wait no that's later so I'll

00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:16,120
so I think it looks good.

00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:27,960
Hey Hannah it's Frederick. Okay when you think it's ready to send to the solver you can send it off.

00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,520
Okay.

00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:43,880
I mean just yeah mentioned that there are some bodies hidden.

00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:55,720
And you can yep press the generate study. Awesome yay okay.

00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:03,960
All right and now it takes like as I said like 30 around 30 to 40 minutes until it's solved but

00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:11,800
also it's four minutes past three. I'm sorry that it took four minutes longer but awesome generally

00:49:24 --> 00:49:48,600
Hey!..... I am a voice agent here to support you during the design task.....I can hear what you are saying, and I can see your screen and follow along with you while you work on the task. Occasionally, I will ask you questions that are supposed to help you think through the design task.

00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:22,120
wonderful. Also you stayed more or less in time so let me kind of like stop the recording and then I'll.

00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:59,800
So

00:50:26 --> 00:50:30,680
Hey… Here is a question for you… What do you think about the generated design?
Is there anything you would like to change?

00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:28,360
okay. Hey here is a question for you. What do you think about the generated design?

00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:35,320
I think the generated design

00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:43,720
is good. It definitely would fit in the allotted space. There's plenty of space in front of each

00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:54,200
of the bolt areas to go back and perform maintenance. This one in the back might be

00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:07,880
a little tight. Yeah I mean the way it looks with all these like lumps along the edge would

00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,480
be hard to specifically manufacture but that might just be this design.

00:51:17 --> 00:51:22,520
Great... Can you explain…What is your goal when comparing the different designs?

00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:19,320
Great can you explain what is your goal when comparing the different designs?

00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:33,000
When comparing them I would say to find you know the one that looks like it would be

00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,560
simplest to manufacture that you could produce multiple in a short amount of time

00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:48,440
and of course meets all the requirements. It's strong hopefully not too heavy.

00:51:49,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah it can carry the proper weight but also be yeah lightweight like it says.

00:52:25 --> 00:52:28,360
Great.... Can you explain how you think the designs differ regarding aspects of manufacturing and assembly?

00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:17,720
So I want to compare yeah these aspects to pick the best outcomes.

00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:37,400
assembly? Yeah so I'm not super familiar with all of these manufacturing methods

00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,480
but like I was saying about this first one I was looking at how it's kind of

00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:48,360
lumpy and there aren't really like smooth lines and edges.

00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:55,080
That's something you have to make probably a specific mold for

00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:06,600
or you know something like this you wouldn't mill but the general shape you know without those very

00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:15,960
specific kind of textures something more like this how it's smooth edges flat sides

00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:29,400
that would be easier to manufacture.

00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:49,000
So yeah with this one it seems like it kind of even though technically there's space in

00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,520
front of that area you wouldn't be able to access that if it were on the damper.

00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:00,360
You could only access it from the bottom which I believe is not possible

00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,440
or maybe technically that could be possible but it's not the easiest way to access

00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,080
that back bolt back here.

00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:18,040
And also this one has a lot of material so I assume it would be heavy.

00:54:22 --> 00:54:23,160
Ok... And How much do you trust the generated designs?

00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:23,160
Okay and how much do you trust the generated designs?

00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,520
How much do I trust the generated designs?

00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:40,680
I think that would depend on you know their qualities listed over here factor safety

00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,920
maximum stress.

00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,480
Um I likely wouldn't just like send something like this off to be immediately manufactured

00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,880
I would kind of maybe make some edits or make my own model.

00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:12,040
Um like I said with you know none of these like kind of curvy chunky areas.

00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:24,760
But I would say this one I would be fairly confident in it has access from that side back here.

00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:31,640
Um factor safety two.

00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:38,920
Raise less than a kilogram.

00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:51,800
Okay.

00:55:51,800 --> 00:56:02,680
So

00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:13,560
so

00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:29,800
so I'm just kind of going through and comparing all of these metrics over here.

00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,080
I can see that this one is pretty similar to the one that was recommended.

00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,800
I'll come forward.

00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:45,560
Hey Hannah it's Frederick.

00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,400
Hi.

00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,040
Can you hear me?

00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,320
Yes.

00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,800
Great.

00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:57,240
Just as a reminder you can also um at the top left of that view you can change the display.

00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:05,160
So there you have like a card sort of like display when you click on it and you see what I mean and

00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:12,280
it can be easier sometimes to compare or even the scatter plot on the one further right where it

00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,000
plays out like more like from a stats perspective like minimum factor of safety and mass.

00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,200
And then I think also you can if you go back to the to the gallery view right you can

00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,760
I think when you hover over one of the designs yeah you can select it and I think

00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,240
by that select an outcome or can you star it um I think you can then

00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,920
compare even multiple ones together.

00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:53,480
All right click and and star it I think how did that work uh no there is some some way maybe if

00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:00,360
you I think if you have multiple ones but there's the idea that I think if you select multiple ones

00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:07,400
you can compare them even maybe on the bottom it says multiple selection I'm sorry I'm not I'm not

00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:14,440
entirely sure how it works yeah click that one okay oh yeah right so that might be might be

00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,080
useful okay I'm out just a couple of hints thank you.

00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:30,680
Thank you.

00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,280
Thank you.

00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:49,080
Thank you.

00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,680
Thank you.

01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:27,000
So it seems like from comparing these that a displacement of under a millimeter is pretty good

01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,120
and a mass of under a kilogram is pretty good.

01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,440
When comparing all of these that seems like the general range

01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,360
like something like this seems like too much of a displacement

01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:50,920
compared to how the majority of these are under a millimeter. I'm saying with

01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:56,040
the mass a lot of these ones down here are over a kilogram but then these ones

01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:02,120
are closer to that one kilogram range.

01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Thank you.

01:01:52,440 --> 01:02:00,360
This one is super lightweight and has a comparable max stress to all of these other

01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:04,120
heavier models so I would say that is one I would keep.

01:02:20 --> 01:02:22,440
Hey... what impact and difference does the manufacturing method have on the generated geometry?

01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:12,440
Up here.

01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:33,880
Well this says additive manufacturing which means that you're more able to do

01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:38,680
different kinds of shapes. There are fewer limitations

01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,640
on what kind of lines and shapes you can do as far as I know.

01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:50,680
So that should be fine.

01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:56,120
Hannah it's Frederick again. I just saw like there's like a star

01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:04,840
in that view when you go to the top menu bar and then to the left you see like a tagging you can

01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:09,000
add it to favorites. I think that's how it works so if you want to kind of like say okay that's

01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,480
one of the designs I want to keep you can say star and then if you go back I think it keeps it.

01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:21,560
Yeah right and the top right in the gallery you see there's a star

01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:26,360
so that's also how you can keep track which ones you.

01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:36,440
Okay, if you give favor. Sorry, so now okay wait one second you see it now here.

01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:44,280
Okay so and the thumbs up are the ones Fusion suggests which also the ones up here.

01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:53,960
Okay and I'll pick three or four for the three. Okay right unless you want to make

01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:59,880
changes but you can also just select three. Okay all right I'm out.

01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:11,160
So

01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:22,440
so

01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:36,440
I think I'll also select this one because

01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,400
of its pretty comparable statistics. The displacement is less than a millimeter and

01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:51,000
it's fairly light considering how much material there is with a strength you know comparable to

01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:05,000
the rest of them and though it says the method is casting it seems like it could be done with

01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,080
other methods but I'm no manufacturing expert.

01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:21,160
So

01:05:47 --> 01:05:52,520
Hey... how important is the mass-to-strength ratio of the pieces in your evaluation?

01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:31,240
so

01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,240
We would want

01:05:53,240 --> 01:06:04,920
low mass to high strength. I would say that's pretty important considering that our goals are

01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:14,840
to minimize the weight and maximize the strength. So I think from this one

01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:25,720
yeah so this other one has a much better mass to strength ratio

01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:32,600
so maybe I should rethink that.

01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:53,400
Oh this one is even lighter than that first one that I picked 0.536 kilograms.

01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:07,400
This one has a really high factor of safety.

01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:17,640
But it seems like mass to strength is more important.

01:07:26 --> 01:07:36,600
Hey..  Which material and manufacturing method combination do you think works best for this task?

01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:24,600
So inevitably we'll have to sacrifice.

01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:44,200
I'm not sure but it seems that aluminum provides the most lightweight solution

01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:53,320
because all of these recommended outcomes are aluminum because they have that mass

01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:58,280
to strength ratio that minimizes mass and maximizes strength whereas

01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,480
yeah like stainless steel they're all pretty high in the mass category

01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:18,360
and same with iron which it gives them a higher factor of safety but or not necessarily for

01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:25,400
stainless steel but aluminum seems to really maximize how lightweight it can be while still

01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:38,200
being strong. So I think I'll also start this.

01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:48,840
So that should be three.

01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:55,560
